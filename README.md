I was responsible for building the education hub through the full stack. I designed the tables and stored procedures for data management in Microsoft SQL Server. I also built the API endpoints, models, and methods that facilitate all of the HTTP requests and responses. I created and tested the frontend of the education hub that allows users to view all of the education resources offered by MoneFi and this platform allows administrators to manage the data in real time.
