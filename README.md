I was responsible for building the education hub through the full stack. I designed all of the data management in Microsoft SQL Server using Transact-SQL. I created models, methods, and API endpoints in .Net using C#. I built the frontend for data content management using JavaScript, XML, and CSS in React.js. Please note the list below of the various actions I completed in this project.

● Assembled a UI for educational content management with UX feedback with XML and CSS styling in React.js

● Implemented dynamic search and filter features to provide an intuitive and organized user interface that accurately reflects relevant information from the database with JavaScript and XML within React.js

● Designed and built SQL server tables to support a relational database for education courses

● Created stored procedures with T-SQL to facilitate data management with HTTP requests

● Designed and built .NET API endpoints in C# to receive and send responses in JSON

● Ensured property security layers in C# on all appropriate API endpoints 

● Created models, methods, and interfaces in C# to connect front end AJAX calls to the SQL server database

● Created and deployed dynamic content management forms with Formik and Yup in React.js with JavaScript

● Utilized Git and GitHub for proper source control in conjunction with other software engineers

● Conducted daily stand-up meetings and Agile methodologies with sprints, code reviews, and code talks
